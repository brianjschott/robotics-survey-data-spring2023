# robotics-survey-data-spring2023

## Description

Two CSV files are available to you, comprising the entry and exit data for the Fall 2022 Robotics students. Note that not all students responded to either survey. The email addresses have been "hashed" using the MD5 algorithm, which converts each email to an ID that cannot be reversed to discover the original email. A student who completed both surveys will have the same hash value, allowing us to identify those students without revealing who they are.

For the following two spreadsheets:
- Import into pandas as DataFrames
- Display the mean, median, and mode of each dataset of each dataset
- Display the standard deviation and interquartile range
- Make observations in each lab as to what the data shows you
- Make an inference as to what the data may tell you about the students

Answer all questions in the text space before or after each section of code.
