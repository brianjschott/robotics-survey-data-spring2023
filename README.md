# robotics-survey-data-spring2023

## Description

Two CSV files are available to you, comprising the entry and exit data for the Fall 2022 Robotics students. Note that not all students responded to either survey. The email addresses have been "hashed" using the MD5 algorithm, which converts each email to an ID that cannot be reversed to discover the original email. A student who completed both surveys will have the same hash value, allowing us to identify those students without revealing who they are.

For the following two spreadsheets:
- Import into pandas as DataFrames
- Display the mean, median, and mode of each dataset of each dataset
- Display the standard deviation and interquartile range
- Make observations in each lab as to what the data shows you: How is the center of the dataset organized? How much spread does the data have?
- Make an inference/inferences as to what the data may tell you about the students

Answer all questions in the text space before or after each section of code. You work will be assessed on the following qualities:
- Am I using the pandas library to import each dataframe?
- Am I displaying the data about each dataset?
- Am I commenting my code to explain each series of steps I am taking?
- Am I making observations relating to the central tendency/variability of each data set?
- Am I making inferences supported by data from the dataset?

If you can, try to merge both datasets by matching each set up by email hash.
